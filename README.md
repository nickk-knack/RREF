# RREF
This program uses a combination of strict Gauss reduction + strict back reduction and strict Gauss-Jordan reduction to find both the REF and RREF forms of a given matrix. The REF form is only presented in the Gauss + back reduction mode, since its essentially an intermediary step.

Literally just implementing these methods as I've learned it in my linear algebra class. Not at all optimal, something is probably wrong somewhere but it works for the few test cases I've tried. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
